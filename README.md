## üì¶ Database Setup

1. Create a MySQL database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hospital;
   USE hospital;
   ```

2. Create tables:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE patients (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       age INT,
       gender VARCHAR(10)
   );

   CREATE TABLE doctors (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       specialization VARCHAR(100)
   );

   CREATE TABLE appointments (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
       patient_id INT,
       doctor_id INT,
       appointment_date DATE,
       FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
       FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
   );
   ```

## üöÄ How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HospitalManagementSystem.git
   cd HospitalManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Configure Database Connection**
   In `HospitalManagementSystemGUI.java`, update:

   ```java
   static final String URL = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital";
   static final String USER = "root";
   static final String PASS = "your_password";
   ```

3. **Add MySQL Connector**

   * If using an IDE, add `mysql-connector-java.jar` to your project libraries.
   * If using command line, include it in the classpath.

4. **Compile & Run**

   ```bash
   javac HospitalManagementSystemGUI.java
   java HospitalManagementSystemGUI
   ```
